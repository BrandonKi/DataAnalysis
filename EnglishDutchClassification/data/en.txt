en|Linguistics is the scientific study of language.Linguistics is based on theoretical as well as descriptive
en|study of language and is also interlinked with the applied fields of language studies and
en|language learning, which entails the study of specific languages. Before the 20th century, linguistics evolved
en|in conjunction with literary study and did not exclusively employ scientific methods.Traditional areas of linguistic
en|analysis correspond to syntax (rules governing the structure of sentences), semantics (meaning), morphology (structure of
en|words), phonetics (speech sounds and equivalent gestures in sign languages), phonology (the abstract sound system
en|of a particular language), and pragmatics (how social context contributes to meaning). Subdisciplines such as
en|biolinguistics (the study of the biological variables and evolution of language) and psycholinguistics (the study
en|of psychological factors in human language) bridge many of these divisions.Linguistics encompasses many branches and
en|subfields that span both theoretical and practical applications. Theoretical linguistics (including traditional descriptive linguistics) is
en|concerned with understanding the universal and fundamental nature of language and developing a general theoretical
en|framework for describing it. Applied linguistics seeks to utilise the scientific findings of the study
en|of language for practical purposes, such as developing methods of improving language education and literacy.Linguistic
en|features may be studied through a variety of perspectives: synchronically (by describing the shifts in
en|a language at a certain specific point of time) or diachronically (through the historical development
en|of language over several periods of time), in monolinguals or in multilinguals, amongst children or
en|amongst adults, in terms of how it is being learned or how it was acquired,
en|as abstract objects or as cognitive structures, through written texts or through oral elicitation, and
en|finally through mechanical data collection or through practical fieldwork.Linguistics emerged from the field of philology,
en|of which some branches are more qualitative and holistic in approach. Today, philology and linguistics
en|are now variably described as related fields, subdisciplines, or separate fields of language study but,
en|by and large, linguistics can be seen as an umbrella term. Linguistics is also related
en|to the philosophy of language, stylistics, rhetoric, semiotics, lexicography, and translation. Major subdisciplines = Historical
en|linguistics = Historical linguistics is the study of how language changes in history, particularly with
en|regard to a specific language or a group of languages. Western trends in historical linguistics
en|date back to roughly the late 18th century, when the discipline grew out of philology,
en|the study of ancient texts and oral traditions.Historical linguistics emerged as one of the first
en|few sub-disciplines in the field, and was most widely practised during the late 19th century.
en|Despite a shift in focus in the 20th century towards formalism and generative grammar, which
en|studies the universal properties of language, historical research today still remains a significant field of
en|linguistic inquiry. Subfields of the discipline include language change and grammaticalisation.Historical linguistics studies language change
en|either diachronically (through a comparison of different time periods in the past and present) or
en|in a synchronic manner (by observing developments between different variations that exist within the current
en|linguistic stage of a language).At first, historical linguistics was the cornerstone of comparative linguistics, which
en|involves a study of the relationship between different languages. At that time, scholars of historical
en|linguistics were only concerned with creating different categories of language families, and reconstructing prehistoric proto-languages
en|by using both the comparative method and the method of internal reconstruction. Internal reconstruction is
en|the method by which an element that contains a certain meaning is re-used in different
en|contexts or environments where there is a variation in either sound or analogy.The reason for
en|this had been to describe well-known Indo-European languages, many of which had long written histories.
en|Scholars of historical linguistics also studied Uralic languages, another European language family for which very
en|little written material existed back then. After that, there also followed significant work on the
en|corpora of other languages, such as the Austronesian languages and the Native American language families.
en|The above approach of comparativism in linguistics is now, however, only a small part of
en|the much broader discipline called historical linguistics. The comparative study of specific Indo-European languages is
en|considered a highly specialised field today, while comparative research is carried out over the subsequent
en|internal developments in a language: in particular, over the development of modern standard varieties of
en|languages, and over the development of a language from its standardized form to its varieties.For
en|instance, some scholars also tried to establish super-families, linking, for example, Indo-European, Uralic, and other
en|language families to Nostratic. While these attempts are still not widely accepted as credible methods,
en|they provide necessary information to establish relatedness in language change. This is generally hard to
en|find for events long ago, due to the occurrence of chance word resemblances and variations
en|between language groups. A limit of around 10,000 years is often assumed for the functional
en|purpose of conducting research. It is also hard to date various proto-languages. Even though several
en|methods are available, these languages can be dated only approximately.Today, with a subsequent re-development of
en|grammatical studies, historical linguistics studies the change in language on a relational basis between dialect
en|to dialect during one period, as well as between those in the past and the
en|present period, and looks at morphological, syntactical, and phonetical evolution and shifts. = Syntax and
en|morphology = Syntax and morphology are branches of linguistics concerned with the order and structure
en|of meaningful linguistic units such as words and morphemes. Syntacticians study the rules and constraints
en|that govern how speakers of a language can organize words into sentences. Morphologists study similar
en|rules for the order of morphemes—sub-word units such as prefixes and suffixes—and how they may
en|be combined to form words.Words, along with clitics, are generally accepted as being the smallest
en|units of syntax. But in most languages, if not all, many words can be related
en|to other words by rules that collectively describe the grammar for that language. For example,
en|English speakers recognize that the words dog and dogs are closely related, differentiated only by
en|the plurality morpheme "-s", only found bound to noun phrases. Speakers of English recognize these
en|relations from their innate knowledge of the English language's rules of word formation. They infer
en|intuitively that dog is to dogs as cat is to cats; and, in similar fashion,
en|dog is to dog catcher as dish is to dishwasher. By contrast, Classical Chinese has
en|very little morphology, using almost exclusively unbound morphemes ("free" morphemes) and depending on word order
en|to convey meaning. (Most words in modern Standard Chinese ["Mandarin"], however, are compounds and most
en|roots are bound.) These are understood as grammars that represent the morphology of the language.
en|The rules understood by a speaker reflect specific patterns or regularities in the way words
en|are formed from smaller units in the language they are using, and how those smaller
en|units interact in speech. In this way, morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies
en|patterns of word formation within and across languages and attempts to formulate rules that model
en|the knowledge of the speakers of those languages.Changes in sound and spelling between a base
en|word and its origin may be partial to literacy skills. Studies show that the presence
en|of modification in phonology and orthography makes morphologically complex words harder to understand and that
en|the absence of modification between a base word and its origin makes morphologically complex words
en|easier to understand. Morphologically complex words are easier to comprehend when they include a base
en|word.Polysynthetic languages, such as Chukchi, have words composed of many morphemes. The Chukchi word "təmeyŋəlevtpəγtərkən",
en|for example, meaning "I have a fierce headache", is composed of eight morphemes t-ə-meyŋ-ə-levt-pəγt-ə-rkən that
en|may be glossed. The morphology of such languages allows for each consonant and vowel to
en|be understood as morphemes, while the grammar of the language indicates the usage and understanding
en|of each morpheme.The discipline that deals specifically with the sound changes occurring within morphemes is
en|morphophonology. = Semantics and pragmatics = Semantics and pragmatics are branches of linguistics concerned with
en|meaning. These subfields have traditionally been divided according to aspects of meaning: "semantics" refers to
en|grammatical and lexical meanings, while "pragmatics" is concerned with meaning in context. The framework of
en|formal semantics studies the denotations of sentences and how they are composed from the meanings
en|of their constituent expressions. Formal semantics draws heavily on philosophy of language and uses formal
en|tools from logic and computer science. Cognitive semantics ties linguistic meaning to general aspects of
en|cognition, drawing on ideas from cognitive science such as prototype theory. Pragmatics includes features like
en|speech acts, implicature, and talk in interaction. Unlike semantics, which examines meaning that is conventional
en|or "coded" in a given language, pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not
en|only on the structural and linguistic knowledge (grammar, lexicon, etc.) of the speaker and listener,
en|but also on the context of the utterance, any pre-existing knowledge about those involved, the
en|inferred intent of the speaker, and other factors. In that respect, pragmatics explains how language
en|users can overcome apparent ambiguity since meaning relies on the manner, place, time, etc. of
en|an utterance. = Phonetics and phonology = Phonetics and phonology are branches of linguistics concerned
en|with sounds (or the equivalent aspects of sign languages). Phonetics is largely concerned with the
en|physical aspects of sounds such as their articulation, acoustics, production, and perception. Phonology is concerned
en|with the linguistic abstractions and categorizations of sounds, and it tells us what sounds are
en|in a language, how they do and can combine into words, and explains why certain
en|phonetic features are important to identifying a word. = Typology = Language varieties Languages exist
en|on a wide continuum of conventionalization with blurry divisions between concepts such as dialects and
en|languages. Languages can undergo internal changes which lead to the development of subvarieties such as
en|linguistic registers, accents, and dialects. Similarly, languages can undergo changes caused by contact with speakers
en|of other languages, and new language varieties may be born from these contact situations through
en|the process of language genesis. = Contact varieties = Contact varieties such as pidgins and
en|creoles are language varieties that often arise in situations of sustained contact between communities that
en|speak different languages. Pidgins are language varieties with limited conventionalization where ideas are conveyed through
en|simplified grammars that may grow more complex as linguistic contact continues. Creole languages are language
en|varieties similar to pidgins but with greater conventionalization and stability. As children grow up in
en|contact situations, they may learn a local pidgin as their native language. Through this process
en|of acquisition and transmission, new grammatical features and lexical items are created and introduced to
en|fill gaps in the pidgin eventually developing into a complete language. Not all language contact
en|situations result in the development of a pidgin or creole, and researchers have studied the
en|features of contact situations that make contact varieties more likely to develop. Often these varieties
en|arise in situations of colonization and enslavement, where power imbalances prevent the contact groups from
en|learning the other's language but sustained contact is nevertheless maintained. The subjugated language in the
en|power relationship is the substrate language, while the dominant language serves as the superstrate. Often
en|the words and lexicon of a contact variety come from the superstrate, making it the
en|lexifier, while grammatical structures come from the substrate, but this is not always the case.
en|= Dialect = A dialect is a variety of language that is characteristic of a
en|particular group among the language's speakers. The group of people who are the speakers of
en|a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity. This is what differentiates
en|a dialect from a register or a discourse, where in the latter case, cultural identity
en|does not always play a role. Dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical
en|and phonological rules, linguistic features, and stylistic aspects, but have not been given an official
en|status as a language. Dialects often move on to gain the status of a language
en|due to political and social reasons. Other times, dialects remain marginalized, particularly when they are
en|associated with marginalized social groups. Differentiation amongst dialects (and subsequently, languages) is based upon the
en|use of grammatical rules, syntactic rules, and stylistic features, though not always on lexical use
en|or vocabulary. The popular saying that "a language is a dialect with an army and
en|navy" is attributed as a definition formulated by Max Weinreich. We may as individuals be
en|rather fond of our own dialect. This should not make us think, though, that it
en|is actually any better than any other dialect. Dialects are not good or bad, nice
en|or nasty, right or wrong – they are just different from one another, and it
en|is the mark of a civilised society that it tolerates different dialects just as it
en|tolerates different races, religions and sexes. = Standard language = When a dialect is documented
en|sufficiently through the linguistic description of its vocabulary and grammar, which has emerged through the
en|consensual laws from within its community, it gains political and national recognition through a country
en|or region's policies. That is the stage when a language is considered a standard variety,
en|one whose linguistic patterns have now stabilised from within the consent of speech community participants,
en|after sufficient evolution, improvisation, correction, growth, and, above all, codification by its speakers. Standard languages
en|may also develop multiple standard varieties, e g. Standard English English and Standard American English,
en|Standard Canadian English, Standard Irish English. These languages are called pluricentric languages and develop in
en|a process called "language making". Occasionally linguists do not agree on how to conceptualize standard
en|varieties, e.g. standard German (see One Standard German Axiom), which should not be too surprising
en|as language experts, too, have a stake in the language making process. = Relativity =
en|As constructed popularly through the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, relativists believe that the structure of a particular
en|language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or
en|her world view. Universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception as there is
en|in the human capacity for language, while relativists believe that this varies from language to
en|language and person to person. While the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea
en|expressed through the writings of American linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, it was
en|Sapir's student Harry Hoijer who termed it thus. The 20th century German linguist Leo Weisgerber
en|also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity. Relativists argue for the case of differentiation
en|at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. The emergence of cognitive linguistics in
en|the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity. Thinkers like George Lakoff have argued
en|that language reflects different cultural metaphors, while the French philosopher of language Jacques Derrida's writings,
en|especially about deconstruction, have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in
en|linguistics, for which he was heavily criticized in the media at the time of his
en|death. Structures Linguistic structures are pairings of meaning and form. Any particular pairing of meaning
en|and form is a Saussurean linguistic sign. For instance, the meaning "cat" is represented worldwide
en|with a wide variety of different sound patterns (in oral languages), movements of the hands
en|and face (in sign languages), and written symbols (in written languages). Linguistic patterns have proven
en|their importance for the knowledge engineering field especially with the ever-increasing amount of available data.
en|Linguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers
en|know (not always consciously). All linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that
en|are combined according to (sub)conscious rules, over multiple levels of analysis. For instance, consider the
en|structure of the word "tenth" on two different levels of analysis. On the level of
en|internal word structure (known as morphology), the word "tenth" is made up of one linguistic
en|form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality. The rule governing the combination of
en|these forms ensures that the ordinality marker "th" follows the number "ten." On the level
en|of sound structure (known as phonology), structural analysis shows that the "n" sound in "tenth"
en|is made differently from the "n" sound in "ten" spoken alone. Although most speakers of
en|English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of
en|"tenth", they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure. Linguists focused
en|on structure find and analyze rules such as these, which govern how native speakers use
en|language. = Grammar = Grammar is a system of rules which governs the production and
en|use of utterances in a given language. These rules apply to sound as well as
en|meaning, and include componential subsets of rules, such as those pertaining to phonology (the organisation
en|of phonetic sound systems), morphology (the formation and composition of words), and syntax (the formation
en|and composition of phrases and sentences). Modern frameworks that deal with the principles of grammar
en|include structural and functional linguistics, and generative linguistics.Sub-fields that focus on a grammatical study of
en|language include the following: Phonetics, the study of the physical properties of speech sound production
en|and perception, and delves into their acoustic and articulatory properties Phonology, the study of sounds
en|as abstract elements in the speaker's mind that distinguish meaning (phonemes) Morphology, the study of
en|morphemes, or the internal structures of words and how they can be modified Syntax, the
en|study of how words combine to form grammatical phrases and sentences Semantics, the study of
en|lexical and grammatical aspects of meaning Pragmatics, the study of how utterances are used in
en|communicative acts, and the role played by situational context and non-linguistic knowledge in the transmission
en|of meaning Discourse analysis, the analysis of language use in texts (spoken, written, or signed)
en|Stylistics, the study of linguistic factors (rhetoric, diction, stress) that place a discourse in context
en|Semiotics, the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism,
en|signification, and communication = Discourse = Discourse is language as social practice (Baynham, 1995) and
en|is a multilayered concept. As a social practice, discourse embodies different ideologies through written and
en|spoken texts. Discourse analysis can examine or expose these ideologies. Discourse influences genre, which is
en|chosen in response to different situations and finally, at micro level, discourse influences language as
en|text (spoken or written) at the phonological or lexico-grammatical level. Grammar and discourse are linked
en|as parts of a system. A particular discourse becomes a language variety when it is
en|used in this way for a particular purpose, and is referred to as a register.
en|There may be certain lexical additions (new words) that are brought into play because of
en|the expertise of the community of people within a certain domain of specialization. Registers and
en|discourses therefore differentiate themselves through the use of vocabulary, and at times through the use
en|of style too. People in the medical fraternity, for example, may use some medical terminology
en|in their communication that is specialized to the field of medicine. This is often referred
en|to as being part of the "medical discourse", and so on. = Lexicon = The
en|lexicon is a catalogue of words and terms that are stored in a speaker's mind.
en|The lexicon consists of words and bound morphemes, which are parts of words that can
en|not stand alone, like affixes. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic
en|expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon. Dictionaries represent
en|attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound
en|morphemes are not included. Lexicography, closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science
en|of mapping the words into an encyclopedia or a dictionary. The creation and addition of
en|new words (into the lexicon) is called coining or neologization, and the new words are
en|called neologisms. It is often believed that a speaker's capacity for language lies in the
en|quantity of words stored in the lexicon. However, this is often considered a myth by
en|linguists. The capacity for the use of language is considered by many linguists to lie
en|primarily in the domain of grammar, and to be linked with competence, rather than with
en|the growth of vocabulary. Even a very small lexicon is theoretically capable of producing an
en|infinite number of sentences. = Style = Stylistics also involves the study of written, signed,
en|or spoken discourse through varying speech communities, genres, and editorial or narrative formats in the
en|mass media. It involves the study and interpretation of texts for aspects of their linguistic
en|and tonal style. Stylistic analysis entails the analysis of description of particular dialects and registers
en|used by speech communities. Stylistic features include rhetoric, diction, stress, satire, irony, dialogue, and other
en|forms of phonetic variations. Stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical
en|works of literature, popular fiction, news, advertisements, and other forms of communication in popular culture
en|as well. It is usually seen as a variation in communication that changes from speaker
en|to speaker and community to community. In short, Stylistics is the interpretation of text. In
en|the 1960s, Jacques Derrida, for instance, further distinguished between speech and writing, by proposing that
en|written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself. Palaeography is therefore
en|the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts (as signs and symbols) in language.
en|The formal study of language also led to the growth of fields like psycholinguistics, which
en|explores the representation and function of language in the mind; neurolinguistics, which studies language processing
en|in the brain; biolinguistics, which studies the biology and evolution of language; and language acquisition,
en|which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages. Approaches
en|= Humanistic = The fundamental principle of humanistic linguistics, especially rational and logical grammar, is
en|that language is an invention created by people. A semiotic tradition of linguistic research considers
en|language a sign system which arises from the interaction of meaning and form. The organisation
en|of linguistic levels is considered computational. Linguistics is essentially seen as relating to social and
en|cultural studies because different languages are shaped in social interaction by the speech community. Frameworks
en|representing the humanistic view of language include structural linguistics, among others.Structural analysis means dissecting each
en|linguistic level: phonetic, morphological, syntactic, and discourse, to the smallest units. These are collected into
en|inventories (e.g. phoneme, morpheme, lexical classes, phrase types) to study their interconnectedness within a hierarchy
en|of structures and layers. Functional analysis adds to structural analysis the assignment of semantic and
en|other functional roles that each unit may have. For example, a noun phrase may function
en|as the subject or object of the sentence; or the agent or patient.Functional linguistics, or
en|functional grammar, is a branch of structural linguistics. In the humanistic reference, the terms structuralism
en|and functionalism are related to their meaning in other human sciences. The difference between formal
en|and functional structuralism lies in the way that the two approaches explain why languages have
en|the properties they have. Functional explanation entails the idea that language is a tool for
en|communication, or that communication is the primary function of language. Linguistic forms are consequently explained
en|by an appeal to their functional value, or usefulness. Other structuralist approaches take the perspective
en|that form follows from the inner mechanisms of the bilateral and multilayered language system. =
en|Biological = Approaches such as cognitive linguistics and generative grammar study linguistic cognition with a
en|view towards uncovering the biological underpinnings of language. In Generative Grammar, these underpinning are understood
en|as including innate domain-specific grammatical knowledge. Thus, one of the central concerns of the approach
en|is to discover what aspects of linguistic knowledge are innate and which are not.Cognitive Linguistics,
en|in contrast, rejects the notion of innate grammar, and studies how the human mind creates
en|linguistic constructions from event schemas, and the impact of cognitive constraints and biases on human
en|language. In cognitive linguistics, language is approached via the senses.A closely related approach is evolutionary
en|linguistics which includes the study of linguistic units as cultural replicators. It is possible to
en|study how language replicates and adapts to the mind of the individual or the speech
en|community. Construction grammar is a framework which applies the meme concept to the study of
en|syntax.The generative versus evolutionary approach are sometimes called formalism and functionalism, respectively. This reference is
en|however different from the use of the terms in human sciences. Methodology Modern linguistics is
en|primarily descriptive. Linguists describe and explain features of language without making subjective judgments on whether
en|a particular feature or usage is "good" or "bad". This is analogous to practice in
en|other sciences: a zoologist studies the animal kingdom without making subjective judgments on whether a
en|particular species is "better" or "worse" than another.Prescription, on the other hand, is an attempt
en|to promote particular linguistic usages over others, often favouring a particular dialect or "acrolect". This
en|may have the aim of establishing a linguistic standard, which can aid communication over large
en|geographical areas. It may also, however, be an attempt by speakers of one language or
en|dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects (see Linguistic imperialism). An
en|extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among censors, who attempt to eradicate words and
en|structures that they consider to be destructive to society. Prescription, however, may be practised appropriately
en|in language instruction, like in ELT, where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical items need
en|to be introduced to a second-language speaker who is attempting to acquire the language. =
en|Sources = Most contemporary linguists work under the assumption that spoken data and signed data
en|are more fundamental than written data. This is because Speech appears to be universal to
en|all human beings capable of producing and perceiving it, while there have been many cultures
en|and speech communities that lack written communication; Features appear in speech which are not always
en|recorded in writing, including phonological rules, sound changes, and speech errors; All natural writing systems
en|reflect a spoken language (or potentially a signed one), even with pictographic scripts like Dongba
en|writing Naxi homophones with the same pictogram, and text in writing systems used for two
en|languages changing to fit the spoken language being recorded; Speech evolved before human beings invented
en|writing; Individuals learn to speak and process spoken language more easily and earlier than they
en|do with writing.Nonetheless, linguists agree that the study of written language can be worthwhile and
en|valuable. For research that relies on corpus linguistics and computational linguistics, written language is often
en|much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data. Large corpora of spoken language
en|are difficult to create and hard to find, and are typically transcribed and written. In
en|addition, linguists have turned to text-based discourse occurring in various formats of computer-mediated communication as
en|a viable site for linguistic inquiry. The study of writing systems themselves, graphemics, is, in
en|any case, considered a branch of linguistics. = Analysis = Before the 20th century, linguists
en|analysed language on a diachronic plane, which was historical in focus. This meant that they
en|would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language from the point of view of
en|how it had changed between then and later. However, with the rise of Saussurean linguistics
en|in the 20th century, the focus shifted to a more synchronic approach, where the study
en|was geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations, which existed at the same
en|given point of time. At another level, the syntagmatic plane of linguistic analysis entails the
en|comparison between the way words are sequenced, within the syntax of a sentence. For example,
en|the article "the" is followed by a noun, because of the syntagmatic relation between the
en|words. The paradigmatic plane, on the other hand, focuses on an analysis that is based
en|on the paradigms or concepts that are embedded in a given text. In this case,
en|words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each
en|other to achieve the same conceptual understanding. History The earliest activities in the description of
en|language have been attributed to the 6th-century-BC Indian grammarian Pāṇini who wrote a formal description
en|of the Sanskrit language in his Aṣṭādhyāyī. Today, modern-day theories on grammar employ many of
en|the principles that were laid down then. = Nomenclature = Before the 20th century, the
en|term philology, first attested in 1716, was commonly used to refer to the study of
en|language, which was then predominantly historical in focus. Since Ferdinand de Saussure's insistence on the
en|importance of synchronic analysis, however, this focus has shifted and the term philology is now
en|generally used for the "study of a language's grammar, history, and literary tradition", especially in
en|the United States (where philology has never been very popularly considered as the "science of
en|language").Although the term linguist in the sense of "a student of language" dates from 1641,
en|the term linguistics is first attested in 1847. It is now the usual term in
en|English for the scientific study of language, though linguistic science is sometimes used. Linguistics is
en|a multi-disciplinary field of research that combines tools from natural sciences, social sciences, formal sciences,
en|and the humanities. Many linguists, such as David Crystal, conceptualize the field as being primarily
en|scientific. The term linguist applies to someone who studies language or is a researcher within
en|the field, or to someone who uses the tools of the discipline to describe and
en|analyse specific languages. = Early grammarians = An early formal study of language was in
en|India with Pāṇini, the 6th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology.
en|Pāṇini's systematic classification of the sounds of Sanskrit into consonants and vowels, and word classes,
en|such as nouns and verbs, was the first known instance of its kind. In the
en|Middle East, Sibawayh, a Persian, made a detailed description of Arabic in AD 760 in
en|his monumental work, Al-kitab fii an-naħw (الكتاب في النحو, The Book on Grammar), the first
en|known author to distinguish between sounds and phonemes (sounds as units of a linguistic system).
en|Western interest in the study of languages began somewhat later than in the East, but
en|the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the
en|same conclusions as their contemporaries in the Indic world. Early interest in language in the
en|West was a part of philosophy, not of grammatical description. The first insights into semantic
en|theory were made by Plato in his Cratylus dialogue, where he argues that words denote
en|concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas. This work is the
en|first to use the word etymology to describe the history of a word's meaning. Around
en|280 BC, one of Alexander the Great's successors founded a university (see Musaeum) in Alexandria,
en|where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in Greek, and taught Greek to
en|speakers of other languages. While this school was the first to use the word "grammar"
en|in its modern sense, Plato had used the word in its original meaning as "téchnē
en|grammatikḗ" (Τέχνη Γραμματική), the "art of writing", which is also the title of one of
en|the most important works of the Alexandrine school by Dionysius Thrax. Throughout the Middle Ages,
en|the study of language was subsumed under the topic of philology, the study of ancient
en|languages and texts, practised by such educators as Roger Ascham, Wolfgang Ratke, and John Amos
en|Comenius. = Comparative philology = In the 18th century, the first use of the comparative
en|method by William Jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics. Bloomfield attributes "the first great
en|scientific linguistic work of the world" to Jacob Grimm, who wrote Deutsche Grammatik. It was
en|soon followed by other authors writing similar comparative studies on other language groups of Europe.
en|The study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by Wilhelm von
en|Humboldt, of whom Bloomfield asserts: This study received its foundation at the hands of the
en|Prussian statesman and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835), especially in the first volume of his
en|work on Kavi, the literary language of Java, entitled Über die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues
en|und ihren Einfluß auf die geistige Entwickelung des Menschengeschlechts (On the Variety of the Structure
en|of Human Language and its Influence upon the Mental Development of the Human Race). =
en|20th-century developments = There was a shift of focus from historical and comparative linguistics to
en|synchronic analysis in early 20th century. Structural analysis was improved by Leonard Bloomfield, Louis Hjelmslev;
en|and Zellig Harris who also developed methods of discourse analysis. Functional analysis was developed by
en|the Prague linguistic circle and André Martinet. As sound recording devices became commonplace in the
en|1960s, dialectal recordings were made and archived, and the audio-lingual method provided a technological solution
en|to foreign language learning. The 1960s also saw a new rise of comparative linguistics: the
en|study of language universals in linguistic typology. Towards the end of the century the field
en|of linguistics became divided into further areas of interest with the advent of language technology
en|and digitalised corpora. Areas of research = Sociolinguistics = Sociolinguistics is the study of how
en|language is shaped by social factors. This sub-discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics,
en|and looks at how a language in general, or a set of languages, display variation
en|and varieties at a given point in time. The study of language variation and the
en|different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and idiolects can be tackled through a study
en|of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. Sociolinguists research both style and discourse
en|in language, as well as the theoretical factors that are at play between language and
en|society. = Developmental linguistics = Developmental linguistics is the study of the development of linguistic
en|ability in individuals, particularly the acquisition of language in childhood. Some of the questions that
en|developmental linguistics looks into are how children acquire different languages, how adults can acquire a
en|second language, and what the process of language acquisition is. = Neurolinguistics = Neurolinguistics is
en|the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers
en|are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of
en|experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed
en|by models in psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics, and is focused on investigating how the brain
en|can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending
en|language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language,
en|and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using aphasiology, brain imaging, electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst
en|the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains
en|the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to
en|produce language. = Applied linguistics = Linguists are largely concerned with finding and describing the
en|generalities and varieties both within particular languages and among all languages. Applied linguistics takes the
en|results of those findings and "applies" them to other areas. Linguistic research is commonly applied
en|to areas such as language education, lexicography, translation, language planning, which involves governmental policy implementation
en|related to language use, and natural language processing. "Applied linguistics" has been argued to be
en|something of a misnomer. Applied linguists actually focus on making sense of and engineering solutions
en|for real-world linguistic problems, and not literally "applying" existing technical knowledge from linguistics. Moreover, they
en|commonly apply technical knowledge from multiple sources, such as sociology (e.g., conversation analysis) and anthropology.
en|(Constructed language fits under Applied linguistics.) Today, computers are widely used in many areas of
en|applied linguistics. Speech synthesis and speech recognition use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide voice
en|interfaces to computers. Applications of computational linguistics in machine translation, computer-assisted translation, and natural language
en|processing are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront. Their influence has
en|had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics, as modelling syntactic and semantic theories
en|on computers constraints. Linguistic analysis is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics used by many governments
en|to verify the claimed nationality of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary
en|documentation to prove their claim. This often takes the form of an interview by personnel
en|in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the
en|asylum seeker's native language through an interpreter or in an international lingua franca like English.
en|Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method
en|depending on the languages involved. Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which
en|can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In
en|this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a
en|determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can play a
en|critical role in the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker. =
en|Language documentation = Language documentation combines anthropological inquiry (into the history and culture of language)
en|with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. Lexicography involves the documentation
en|of words that form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a
en|particular language is usually compiled in a dictionary. Computational linguistics is concerned with the statistical
en|or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is
en|applied by speakers during the act of translation and interpretation, as well as in language
en|education – the teaching of a second or foreign language. Policy makers work with governments
en|to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research. Since
en|the inception of the discipline of linguistics, linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing
en|previously undocumented languages. Starting with Franz Boas in the early 1900s, this became the main
en|focus of American linguistics until the rise of formal linguistics in the mid-20th century. This
en|focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly disappearing
en|languages of indigenous peoples. The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description played
en|a role in the development of disciplines such as sociolinguistics, anthropological linguistics, and linguistic anthropology,
en|which investigate the relations between language, culture, and society. The emphasis on linguistic description and
en|documentation has also gained prominence outside North America, with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous
en|languages becoming a focus in some university programmes in linguistics. Language description is a work-intensive
en|endeavour, usually requiring years of field work in the language concerned, so as to equip
en|the linguist to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar. Further, the task of documentation requires
en|the linguist to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question, consisting of texts
en|and recordings, both sound and video, which can be stored in an accessible format within
en|open repositories, and used for further research. = Translation = The sub-field of translation includes
en|the translation of written and spoken texts across media, from digital to print and spoken.
en|To translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another. Translators are
en|often employed by organizations such as travel agencies and governmental embassies to facilitate communication between
en|two speakers who do not know each other's language. Translators are also employed to work
en|within computational linguistics setups like Google Translate, which is an automated program to translate words
en|and phrases between any two or more given languages. Translation is also conducted by publishing
en|houses, which convert works of writing from one language to another in order to reach
en|varied audiences. Academic translators specialize in or are familiar with various other disciplines such as
en|technology, science, law, economics, etc. = Clinical linguistics = Clinical linguistics is the application of
en|linguistic theory to the field of speech-language pathology. Speech language pathologists work on corrective measures
en|to treat communication and swallowing disorders. Chaika (1990) showed that people with schizophrenia who display
en|speech disorders like rhyming inappropriately have attentional dysfunction, as when a patient was shown a
en|color chip and then asked to identify it, responded "looks like clay. Sounds like gray.
en|Take you for a roll in the hay. Heyday, May Day." The color chip was
en|actually clay-colored, so his first response was correct. However, most people suppress or ignore words
en|which rhyme with what they've said unless they are deliberately producing a pun, poem or
en|rap. Even then, the speaker shows connection between words chosen for rhyme and an overall
en|meaning in discourse. People with schizophrenia with speech dysfunction show no such relation between rhyme
en|and reason. Some even produce stretches of gibberish combined with recognizable words. = Computational linguistics
en|= Computational linguistics is the study of linguistic issues in a way that is "computationally
en|responsible", i.e., taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity, so
en|that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and
en|their implementations. Computational linguists also work on computer language and software development. = Evolutionary linguistics
en|= Evolutionary linguistics is a sociobiological approach to analyzing the emergence of the language faculty
en|through human evolution, and also the application of evolutionary theory to the study of cultural
en|evolution among different languages. It is also a study of the dispersal of various languages
en|across the globe, through movements among ancient communities. = Forensic linguistics = Forensic linguistics is
en|the application of linguistic analysis to forensics. Forensic analysis investigates the style, language, lexical use,
en|and other linguistic and grammatical features used in the legal context to provide evidence in
en|courts of law. Forensic linguists have also used their expertise in the framework of criminal
en|cases. See also References Bibliography External links The Linguist List, a global online linguistics community
